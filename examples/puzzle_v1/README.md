## Level Up Your Cairo with Matchbox DAOs Physics Puzzle V1

Matchbox DAO is proud to present the first iteration of "Solve 2 Mint". This is a physics puzzle written in Cairo where the end goal is the user to achieve the highest score possible on any of the given levels by submitting a velocity vector. <br>

Solvers of the puzzle will be given a special role in the Matchbox DAO Discord, be given priority to become beta testers for games on Starknet developed within Matchbox, and have an open line of communication to shape future iterations of Solve 2 Mint or any development ideas they are interested in exploring on Starknet.

The puzzle is based on the original concept of [Solve 2 Mint](https://mirror.xyz/matchboxdao.eth/DzWa-8uOEdjp2BiW1kiA_yS82EXJDyJb-VqWeWALchc) by Topology. <br>

Read through all the instructions, solve the puzzle, join the Discord, and level up your Cairo!<br>

## Instructions
- Read through the game.cairo, levels.cairo, and additional contracts
- Use any programming language or tool of your choice to find a unique solution to any of the levels. Can you beat the current high score?
- Register your Starknet (Argent X or Braavos Wallet) address through the SNS contract so your name will appear on the leaderboard
- Submit your solution through the puzzle front end or contract on Voyager
- Join the Matchbox Discord to meet other puzzle solvers, Starknet devs etc. Give us your feedback on the first iteration, help us build future iterations and different puzzles! 

## Things to Keep In Mind
- Study the contract carefully to understand:
	- The restraints on the input velocity
	- The time step used to forward the scene
	- The way collisions are handled
	- How the game is scored
	- How the uniqueness of a solution is defined
